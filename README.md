# Commnicate-Data-Findings
In this project I have obtained loan data from Prosper. After wrangling and cleaning this data I have explored it using univariat, bivariate and multivariate anlaysis and
from this I have produced a slide show that answers the questions I was most prominentkly trying to answer, namely, what categories are significant in setting borrower APR
and does the relationshoip between said category and borrower APR persists when controlling for other variables. 

Findings:

What was found was found was that Prosper scoresets the borrower APR. From this we looked at what sets te Prosper Score and dound that, income, debt and employment status were
all found to be sigificant factors in determining Prosper score and hence in turn borrower APR. Follwoing this it ws found that this relationship pertains even when homeownership is controld for.
